# MCP: storyboards

A storyboard is a project whose pages are panels at one resolution. These tools
let a connected assistant turn a written scenario into scenes, timed panels with
captions and shot data, and drawn frames. They need the live workspace relay and
act on the storyboard in the relay's tab. Every changing call is one Undo step.

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `create_design_project` | With `kind: "storyboard"`, create a storyboard project: `width` × `height` panels, `pages` blank panels. |
| `describe_storyboard` | Read the frame rate, caption fields, running time, active panel and the act → sequence → scene → panel outline with each panel's ID, duration, captions, shot size, angle, status, tag and layer count. |
| `set_storyboard_settings` | Set the frame rate (`23.976`–`60`) and the default duration of new panels. |
| `add_storyboard_panels` | Add up to 200 blank panels after a panel (or `at_start`) with durations (`seconds` or `frames`), captions by field name and shot data. `start` begins a new scene, sequence or act named `group_name`. Returns the new panel IDs. |
| `update_storyboard_panel` | Change one panel's duration, captions (merged; an empty string clears a field), shot size, angle, status or colour tag. |
| `start_storyboard_group` | Start a new scene, sequence or act at a panel; the rest of its group moves with it. |
| `rename_storyboard_group` | Rename an act, sequence or scene by group ID. |

The project tools work on panels too:

| Tool | In a storyboard |
| --- | --- |
| `select_project_page` | Select a panel before drawing on it. |
| `duplicate_project_page` | Make the next frame: the copy goes right after its source, in the same scene, with its layers, timing, captions and shot data, and becomes the active panel. |
| `copy_page_nodes` | Copy chosen layers (a character, a prop) from one panel to another with a `dx`/`dy` offset. Works in any project. |
| `move_project_page`, `delete_project_page` | Reorder or remove panels. A panel dropped between panels of another scene joins that scene. |
| `describe_project`, `save_project`, `export_project` | Page list, saving the `.emu` and image/PDF export. |

Drawing uses the ordinary editing tools on the selected panel (`add_layer`,
`paint`, `draw_path`, `draw_shape`, `add_text`, `translate_node`,
`set_transform`, `get_view` and others).

## From a scenario

1. Create the project, then call `describe_storyboard` for the caption field
   names (`Action`, `Dialogue`, `Slugging`, `Notes` by default).
2. Break the scenario into scenes and beats. Add each scene with one
   `add_storyboard_panels` call:

```json
{"after":1,"start":"scene","group_name":"Kitchen","panels":[
  {"seconds":3,"size":"wide","captions":{"Slugging":"INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT","Action":"Mia stands at the sink."}},
  {"seconds":2,"size":"close_up","angle":"low","captions":{"Dialogue":"MIA: Who's there?"}}
]}
```

3. Select each panel and draw it on named layers (background, each character,
   arrows), so later frames can reuse them.
4. For a continuing shot, `duplicate_project_page` the panel, move or repaint
   what changes, and update its captions and duration with
   `update_storyboard_panel`.
5. Check the outline and total running time with `describe_storyboard`, and
   each panel with `get_view`.

The assistant's system prompt includes a storyboarding playbook (shot sizes,
continuity, timing and this workflow); its worked example is executed by the
`storyboard_playbook_runs_against_a_live_storyboard_project` test.
